The program allows you to:

The effects are applied randomly within reasonable parameters to create a nostalgic/YTP-style video. You can easily extend the effects by adding more checkboxes in the GUI and implementing corresponding effect functions in the EffectsProcessor class.

Note: Some effects may take longer to process depending on the video length and complexity of the effects selected. The progress bar will help track the generation process.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the code or add any additional effects?
